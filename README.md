# REFACTOR HORISEON WEBSITE

## A classwork practice for refactoring a website. 

- Learning to test HTML, CSS, VS Code, Git Bash, and Git Hub
- Practice creating a repo in GitHub
- Practice commit, push, and pull in GitHub

## Installation

N/A

## User Story

>As a Marketing agency
>
>I want a codebase that follows accessiblity standards
>
>so that our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

>GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
>
>WHEN I view the source code
>
>THEN I find semantic HTML elements
>
>WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
>
>THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
>
>WHEN I view the image elements
>
>THEN I find accessible alt attributes
>
>WHEN I view the heading attributes
>
>THEN they fall in sequential order
>
>WHEN I view the title element
>
>THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Usage

This practice used started code and the student objective was to refactor the webpage. 

This includes:

    1. Technical Acceptance Criteria: 40%
        -Satisfies all of the preceding acceptance criteria plus the following code improvements:
        -Application's links all function correctly
        -Application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure
        -Application's CSS file is properly commented

    2. Deployment: 32%
        -Application deployed at live URL
        -Application loads with no errors
        -Application GitHub URL submitted (using Gitlab)
        -GitHub repository that contains application code

    4. Application Quality: 15%
        -Application resembles (at least 90%) screenshots provided in challenge instructions

    5. Repository Quality: 13%
        -Repository has a unique name
        -Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions
        -Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc
        -Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages
        -Repository contains a quality README file with description, screenshot, and link to deployed application

    6. Some limitations apply:
        -In future lessons, student will learn how to make elements "responsive" so that the web application is optimized for any screen size.  For this project, this is not applicable
